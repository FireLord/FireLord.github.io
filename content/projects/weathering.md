A weather app but with beautiful artwork. These artworks are made by me with suggestions from various people to make it look perfect.
- Made using kotlin and following business logic MVVM to setup everything in the project.
- It uses Glide to load images
- Has LeakCanary to show if there is any memory leak during the debug mode.
- Use openWeatherApi to show weather data and a toggle to switch between dark and light mode.
- Illustration are crafted by me.
